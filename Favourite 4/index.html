    <h2> MY FAVOURITE HOBBIES<br><span id="hobby"> Coding </span> </h2>

    <p> I love Coding Because by Coding we can use our own Creativity to design an app or a game! We can can make any app, game or even a webpage! ðŸ’– I have done 45+ Class, Project and Quizzes of WhiteHat Junior.
        They helps me to learn Coding...
        <br>
        I first heard about WhiteHat Junior from a student in my class, Vihaan Bhasharkar. He had the WhiteHat so after asking he told me about this coding class. I found it intriguing, so I asked my father if we could take the trial class and he said yes. At first I wasn't sure about anything but then I found out that my teacher was super nice and I signed up. I'd say the money paid was worth it.ðŸ˜€

    <h2> Painting / Drawing </h2>
    <p> I also like Drawing and painting but I focus more on drawing than painting.ðŸŽ¨ I do not have painting or drawing classes but literally everyone as in my friends, family and relatives think the opposite of the truth. Still, though I'm great at drawing I've never yet been that satisfied with it.
        <br>
        Drawing is not a problem for me but the only thing is that I can't come up with something to draw.ðŸŽ¨ That's why I usually get model images for me to draw them. To sum this paragraph up I'll say that I can't think of any object, animal or person to draw so I use images to make my drawings.

        <h2>My Favourite Hobby<br><span id="hobby">Reading Books</span></h2>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>I love reading. It helps me calm my mind and that's exactly what I need after a rough day or a long day. ðŸ“–ðŸ“š Reading is very relaxing so I don't need to work hard just to read a simple word, sentence or paragraph. It's very calming and engaging. I also like reading because it also counts as educational studies. Reading develops our brains and gives us the ability to understand life in a much better fashion. ðŸ“•ðŸ“” Besides, there's a lot of room for grammar and language development. When you read a lot, you learn new words all the time. Reading is an excercise for my mind. It opens doors to new knowledge and I've heard that kids who read often grow up to have better cognitive skills.</p>

        <section id="books">
        <p> My favourite books are 'The Midnight Gang' , 'Harry Potter series' , 'Geronimo Stilton Series' and 'Thea Stilton Series'. 
If you have not already read it then I'll tell you summary of 'The Midnight Gang' book. So basically what happens is a story of friendship, theatre and magic â€“ and of course, making dreams come true. When the clock strikes midnight most children are fast asleep, but for the Midnight Gang the journey is just beginning. The Midnight Gang is a secret gang of children who go on midnight adventures in the hospital. Tom follows them and his adventures begin, all whilst dressed in the frilly pink nighty Matron forces him to wear because he didn't bring his pyjamas. ... And, of course, the children.</p>
